# Github-Analytica

GitHub, the go-to hub for developers worldwide, has seen a whopping 12 million contributors shaping around 31 million projects since 2008. It's the busy epicenter of open-source development.

Now, picture this: you're a student navigating the coding universe or someone just stepping into a new stack. GitHub, with its countless projects, feels like a vast library without a roadmap. The challenge here is real - finding your way through the code maze.

So, what's the plan? We're diving into the GitHub realm to decode the secrets. What programming languages are dominating the scene and what trusty sidekicks (dependencies) are being used.

Why bother, you ask? For students grasping coding nuances or those embarking on a new tech stack, it's like having a guidebook. We aim to demystify GitHub, making it more navigable, and bring you insights into the coding practices that define different languages.  Ready to jump into the GitHub adventure with us? ðŸš€
